# Feed Reader Testing
Udacity Front End Web Development - Project 7: Feed Reader Testing

## Synopsis

This is my seventh and final project through Udacity's **Front End Web Development** course, through which I have been reviewing web fundamentals including HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.  In this project I am given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. They've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) but left an incomplete test suite. This project was meant to build out the test suite.

## Files

* **feedreader.js:** Test suite: This contains the code written for this project, which consists of the entire test suite
* **index.html:** Main page, which was already written
* **app.js:** Main application code.  This code was already written, and is the code to be tested.

## Instructions

1. Open index.html in a browser.  If all tests pass the Feed Reader should render normally with the status of each successful test represented as a dot at the bottom of the page.
